<p>In this work, we investigate the problem of colorization of grayscale images. This problem is ill-defined and underconstrained which is why earlier works in this domain have relied on heavy user interaction. We first explored Deep Colorization, which uses multi- scale features and deep neural networks for colorization.</p>
