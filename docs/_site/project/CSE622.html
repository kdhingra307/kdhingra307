<p>The problem of decomposing a N Ã—N unitary into a quantum circuit was inspired from Task- 4 of IBM Quantum Challenge, 2020. In that challenge, we were asked to design a quantum circuit for a predefined unitary matrix, such that it requires a minimum number of gates. One of the approaches with which this problem can be tackled is to use a machine learning algorithm, in which parameters of U3 gates are learned using gradient descent algorithm with the norm between U and circuit used as the cost function. In this project, at first analytical methods to compute the gradients were used, which worked well for classification related tasks but could not hold up to unitary estimation. After that, numerical gradient estimation techniques were used to solve the problem.</p>
